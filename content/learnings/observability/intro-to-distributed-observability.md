## What is Distributed systems?
Distributed systems are a type of computing system that relies on multiple devices or machines working together to achieve a common goal. These systems are designed to be scalable, resilient, and able to handle high levels of concurrency.

One of the main challenges of distributed systems is understanding how the various components interact and affect each other. This is especially important when dealing with complex, distributed systems that span multiple machines or even multiple data centers. Observability tools and techniques can help us identify and resolve issues, optimize performance, and improve the reliability of our systems.

## What is Observability?
Observability is a key aspect of distributed systems. It refers to the ability to monitor and understand the behavior of a system through the collection and analysis of data. This includes metrics, logs, and traces, which provide valuable insights into the performance, reliability, and correctness of a system.

## Key benefits of observability in distributed systems:

- Improved visibility: Observability tools allow us to see what is happening inside our systems and understand how they are behaving. This helps us identify problems and root causes more quickly and accurately.

- Faster incident response: When something goes wrong in a distributed system, observability tools can help us identify the problem and understand its impact. This enables us to respond more quickly and effectively to incidents, minimizing downtime and reducing the negative impact on users.

- Better performance: By collecting and analyzing metrics, logs, and traces, we can gain a deeper understanding of our systems and identify opportunities for optimization. This can lead to improved performance and better utilization of resources.

## Summary
Observability is a crucial aspect of distributed systems. It allows us to monitor and understand the behavior of our systems, identify and resolve issues, and optimize performance. By investing in observability, we can build more reliable and effective distributed systems that deliver value to our users.
