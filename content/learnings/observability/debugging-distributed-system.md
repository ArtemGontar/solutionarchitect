Debugging distributed systems can be a challenging task, as it involves understanding the behavior and interactions of multiple components and systems. Tracing and logs are two key tools that can help us understand and debug distributed systems.

## Usage of tracing for debugging
Tracing involves collecting and storing data on the interactions between the various components of a distributed system. This can include information on request and response times, as well as data on the flow of requests through different components and services. Tracing is particularly useful for debugging distributed systems, as it allows us to see how different components are interacting and affecting each other. There are several methods for implementing tracing in distributed systems, including distributed tracing, instrumentation, and request correlation. Distributed tracing involves collecting trace data from multiple locations and systems, and linking it together to form a complete picture of the request flow. Instrumentation involves adding trace data collection points to our applications and systems, typically using libraries and frameworks such as OpenTracing or Zipkin. Request correlation involves linking trace data with log data, allowing us to see how log events relate to the overall request flow.

## Usage of logging for debugging
Logging involves collecting and storing data on the events and actions of our systems. This can include information on system and application logs, as well as data on user actions and other external events. Logging is an essential tool for debugging distributed systems, as it allows us to see what is happening inside our systems and understand how they are behaving. There are several methods for logging in distributed systems, including structured logging, centralized logging, and distributed logging. Structured logging involves storing log data in a structured format, such as JSON, which allows for easier querying and analysis. Centralized logging involves sending log data to a central location, such as a logging server, for storage and processing. Distributed logging involves sending log data to multiple locations, such as multiple data centers or cloud regions, for increased resiliency and scalability.

## Techniques&Tactics

To effectively debug distributed systems using tracing and logs, it is important to have a systematic approach. Some techniques and tactics that can be helpful include:

- Reproducing the issue: One of the first steps in debugging any problem is to reproduce it. This can help us confirm that the issue is real, and can provide us with more information about the circumstances under which it occurs.

- Identifying the root cause: Once we have reproduced the issue, the next step is to identify the root cause. This can involve analyzing trace and log data, as well as other relevant information such as performance metrics and network traffic. By understanding the root cause, we can determine the most appropriate action to take to resolve the issue.

- Implementing fixes: Once we have identified the root cause, we can implement fixes to address the issue. This may involve modifying code, configuring systems, or taking other appropriate action. It is important to test any fixes to ensure that they are effective and do not cause unintended consequences.

- Monitoring and testing: Once we have implemented fixes, it is important to monitor and test our systems to ensure that the issue has been resolved. This can involve running tests, monitoring performance metrics, and collecting log and trace data. By monitoring and testing our systems, we can confirm that the issue has been resolved, and we can identify any new issues that may arise.

## Summary
Debugging distributed systems using tracing and logs requires a systematic approach and the use of appropriate techniques and tactics. By using these tools effectively, we can identify and resolve issues in our systems and improve their performance, reliability, and correctness.
