Software licenses are agreements that specify the terms and conditions under which software can be used, distributed, and modified. It is important for individuals and organizations to understand the different types of software licenses and how they impact compliance when using software.

## Selecting the Right Software License

| License | Definition| Ground philosophy | Free of charge | Covered by copyright | Examples  |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Public domain | Software that is not protected by copyright and can be used freely by anyone.| No copyright protection.| Yes| No| N/A (not protected by copyright) |
| Freeware| Software that is freely available to the public, but may still be protected by copyright. | Permitting users to use and distribute the software for free.| Yes| Yes| 7-Zip, LibreOffice |
| Shareware | Software that is available for a free trial period, after which the user must purchase a license to continue using it. | Providing a way for users to try out the software before committing to a purchase. | No| Yes| WinZip  |
| Open-source  | Software distributed with a license that allows users to access, modify, and distribute the source code.  | Encouraging collaboration and the sharing of modifications to the source code.| Yes| Yes| Linux, MySQL |
| Commercial| Software that is sold for a fee. | Providing access to the software in exchange for a fee.| No| Yes  | Microsoft Office, Adobe Photoshop |
| Custom  | Licenses tailored to the specific needs of an organization or individual.  | Allowing customization of the terms and conditions of the license to fit the needs of the organization or individual.| Varies| Varies| Dependent on the specific license |

Ground rules:
- Public domain: Can be used, modified, and distributed freely without any legal consequences.
- Freeware: License agreement may specify terms and conditions under which the software can be used. Typically allows users to use and distribute the software, but not to modify or sell it.
- Shareware: Available for a free trial period, after which the user must purchase a license to continue using it. License may include time limits, feature limits, or other restrictions on the use of the software.
- Open-source: Distributed with a license that allows users to access, modify, and distribute the source code. Most common open-source license is the GNU General Public License (GPL), which requires users to distribute any modifications to the source code under the same license. Other popular open-source licenses include the MIT License and the Apache License.
- Commercial: License typically grants users permission to use the software, but does not allow them to modify or distribute the source code. License may include restrictions on the number of users, the length of time the software can be used, and the geographical region in which it can be used.
- Custom: Custom licenses may include terms and conditions that are not found in other types of licenses. For example, a custom license may allow the use of the software for a specific purpose or in a specific environment, or it may include provisions for the distribution of modifications to the source code.

## Conclusion
It is important to carefully review the terms and conditions of any software license before using the software. Failure to comply with the terms of a software license can result in legal consequences, including fines and damages. It is also important to keep track of any licenses that have been purchased and to renew them as needed to maintain compliance.
