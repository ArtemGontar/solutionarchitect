![AWS cost optimization](/posts/clouds/aws-cost-optimization/banner.jpg)

As someone who has been working with AWS for quite some time now, I can attest to the fact that it's easy to let your costs spiral out of control if you're not careful. I've definitely made my fair share of mistakes when it comes to cost optimization, but I've also learned a lot along the way. In this post, I want to share some of the strategies that have worked best for me in keeping my AWS expenses in check.

## 1. Use Reserved Instances
I can't stress enough how much of a difference Reserved Instances can make when it comes to saving money on EC2 instances. By committing to using them for a certain period of time, usually one or three years, you can save up to 75% compared to on-demand instances. I personally prefer to purchase reservations on the Reserved Instances page in the EC2 console.

## 2. Use Spot Instances
Spot instances are a great way to save even more money on EC2 instances. They're unused instances that are available at a discounted price. However, they can be terminated if the spot price goes above your bid, so be sure to use them for workloads that can be interrupted. I personally like to create a spot fleet request in the EC2 console or use the RunInstances API.

## 3. Utilize Auto Scaling
Auto scaling is a no-brainer when it comes to cost optimization. By automatically scaling your resources up or down based on demand, you can save money by only running the resources you need. I personally use the Auto Scaling Group and launch configuration to achieve this.

## 4. Use the Right Instance Types
One of the biggest mistakes I used to make was using the wrong instance types for my workloads. Each instance type is optimized for different types of workloads, so it's important to use the right one for your needs. I personally use the EC2 instance type page to find the right instance type for my workloads.

## 5. Use the Right Storage Types
Just like with instances, different storage types are optimized for different types of workloads. I personally use the Storage option in the EC2 console to select the right storage type for my workloads.

## 6. Use the Right Data Transfer Options
AWS offers different data transfer options, such as data transfer in and data transfer out. I personally use the VPC option in the EC2 console to select the right data transfer option for my needs.

## 7. Use the Right Database Types
Just like with instances and storage, different database types are optimized for different types of workloads. I personally use the RDS option in the EC2 console to select the right database type for my workloads.

## 8. Monitor Your Resources
I've found that monitoring my resources is key to identifying areas where I can save money. I personally use the CloudWatch option in the EC2 console to monitor my resources.

## 9. Use Cost Management Tools
AWS provides cost management tools, such as the Cost Explorer, that can help you understand your costs and find ways to save money. I personally use the Billing and Cost Management option in the EC2 console to access these tools.

## 10. Take Advantage of AWS Savings Plans
AWS Savings Plans is a flexible pricing model that allows you to save up to 72% on your AWS usage, compared to On-Demand pricing, by committing to a consistent amount of usage for a one or three year term. I personally use the Savings Plans option in the EC2 console to purchase a savings plan.

## Bonus: Optimize Your S3 Storage
S3 storage can be a major cost driver, so it's important to optimize your usage. I personally use the S3 Lifecycle policy to automatically transition objects to lower-cost storage classes as they age, and use S3 Intelligent-Tiering for frequently accessed objects that change infrequently. Additionally, I enable S3 object-level logging to track access patterns and identify infrequently accessed objects that can be moved to infrequent access storage classes. I also use S3 Inventory and S3 Analytics to identify and delete unnecessary or outdated objects, and use the S3 Transfer Acceleration to speed up large data transfers to and from S3.

## Conclusion
One thing I've learned from my experience is that cost optimization is an ongoing process. I constantly monitor my resources and usage to identify areas where I can save money, and make adjustments as necessary. Additionally, I review my bill periodically to find areas where I can optimize my spending.

By following these cost optimization strategies, you'll be able to keep your AWS expenses in check and save money in the long run. Remember to regularly monitor your resources, use the right instance and storage types, and take advantage of the cost management tools that AWS provides. Additionally, optimize your S3 storage by using the appropriate storage classes, and by monitoring and eliminating unnecessary or outdated objects. With a bit of planning and attention to detail, you can take full advantage of the benefits that AWS has to offer without breaking the bank.
