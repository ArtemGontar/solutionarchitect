Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are critical components of any organization's infrastructure and systems. They provide a clear understanding of the level of service that a company or service provider is expected to deliver to its customers, as well as the consequences if those expectations are not met. In this article, we will explore the concept of SLO/SLA as a code, as well as an example of how the OpenSLO tool can be used to integrate these agreements into a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.

## Overview of SLO/SLA

Service Level Objectives (SLOs) are metrics that define the level of service that a company or service provider aims to deliver to its customers. These metrics can include availability, performance, or other indicators of service quality. SLOs are typically set at a higher level than Service Level Agreements (SLAs), which are legally binding contracts that outline the specific terms and conditions of a service.

SLOs and SLAs are important because they provide a clear understanding of the service expectations between a company and its customers. They also help to ensure that the company is meeting its commitments to its customers, and that customers are receiving the service they expect.

## SLO/SLA as a code

One approach to managing and enforcing SLOs and SLAs is to treat them as code. This means that the SLOs and SLAs are defined and enforced through automated processes, rather than being managed manually. This can help to ensure that SLOs and SLAs are consistently enforced across an organization, and that any deviations from the agreed-upon service levels are quickly identified and addressed.

To implement SLO/SLA as code, it is necessary to have a system in place for tracking and monitoring the relevant metrics. This can be done through the use of monitoring and alerting tools, such as OpenSLO.

## Example: OpenSLO tool

[OpenSLO](https://openslo.com/) is an open-source tool that can be used to manage and enforce SLOs and SLAs. It allows organizations to define their service level objectives and agreements as code, and then automatically monitor and alert on any deviations from those objectives.

One way to use OpenSLO is to integrate it into a CI/CD pipeline. This can be done by configuring OpenSLO to run as part of the build or deployment process, and to fail the build or deployment if the SLOs or SLAs are not being met. This helps to ensure that only code that meets the required service levels is deployed to production.

Here is an example of how you might use OpenSLO to define and monitor SLAs and SLOs using YAML configuration files:

First, you would define your SLAs and SLOs in a YAML file. For example:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: slo.openslo.io/v1alpha1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: example-service
spec:
  slos:
  - name: uptime-slo
    description: The percentage of time that the service is available.
    objective: 99.99%
    windows:
    - interval: 1h
      target: 99.99%
  - name: error-rate-slo
    description: The percentage of requests that result in an error.
    objective: 0.01%
    windows:
    - interval: 1h
      target: 0.01%
```

This YAML file defines two SLOs for an example service: an uptime SLO and an error rate SLO. The uptime SLO specifies that the service should be available 99.99% of the time, and the error rate SLO specifies that the service should have an error rate of 0.01% or lower.

Next, you would configure OpenSLO to collect data for these SLOs. This might involve setting up monitoring tools to track the uptime and error rate of your service, and sending the data to OpenSLO.

Finally, you can use the OpenSLO web interface or API to monitor the performance of your service against these SLOs. This may involve generating reports, setting up alerts, and reviewing the data to identify any issues or areas for improvement.

By using YAML configuration files and the OpenSLO tool, you can easily define and monitor your SLAs and SLOs to ensure that you are meeting the needs of your customers.

## Integrating into a pipeline on CircleCI

[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) is a popular CI/CD platform that can be used to automate the build, test, and deployment process for software projects. To integrate OpenSLO into a pipeline on CircleCI, you will need to install and configure the OpenSLO CLI on your build machine, as well as define your SLOs and SLAs in a configuration file.

Once you have installed and configured OpenSLO, you can add it to your CircleCI pipeline by including a step in your circle.yml file that runs the OpenSLO CLI. For example:

```bash
jobs:
  build:
    steps:
      - run: openslo check
```

This will cause OpenSLO to run as part of the build process, and to fail the build if the defined SLOs or SLAs are not being met.

## Conclusion

SLO/SLA as a code is a powerful approach to managing and enforcing service level objectives and agreements. By treating these agreements as code, organizations can automate the process of tracking and monitoring service levels, and ensure that only code that meets the required standards is deployed to production. The OpenSLO tool is a useful tool for implementing this approach, and can be easily integrated into a CI/CD pipeline on platforms such as CircleCI.

Overall, adopting an SLO/SLA as a code approach can help organizations to deliver consistently high-quality service to their customers, and to ensure that they are meeting their commitments and upholding their brand reputation. By automating the process of tracking and enforcing service levels, organizations can save time and resources, and focus on delivering the best possible service to their customers.
